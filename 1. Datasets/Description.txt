Chocolate is paramount in our society, it is a food product made from roasted and ground cacao pods, that is available as a liquid, solid or paste, on its own or as a flavoring agent in other foods. Cacao has been consumed in some form since at least the Olmec civilization (19th-11th century BCE) and the majority of Mesoamerican people - including the Maya and Aztecs - made chocolate beverages.

The first solid chocolate bar put into production was made by J. S. Fry & Sons of Bristol, England in 1847 and today it is estimated to be an USD 130.56 billion dollar industry.
